## Things Should do, But I couldn't because of time:

1. Promise Based Code:
    I had used callback here which leads to callback loop while searching several level of sub-categories. It can/can not be removed, but the code may look nice if I would use promise based works.
2. Traverse dynamically around product sub-category:
    You may see there remain two level of sub-categories. If we add another level, then we have to add more queries obviously. But If we could manage to build query on run time, then we may see that we had make it dynamic rather then adding queries manually.
4. Using of ORM: 
    Of curse this may look good in terms of code readability.
